Superstore Data Analysis Project
Introduction
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of analyzing the Superstore dataset using AWS services. We leverage AWS Glue, Crawlers, and Data Catalog to organize and prepare the data, Athena for querying, and QuickSight for visualization.

Tech Stack
AWS S3: Data storage for raw and transformed datasets.
AWS Glue: Data preparation, ETL jobs, and cataloging.
AWS Glue Crawlers: Automated schema inference and table creation.
AWS Glue Data Catalog: Centralized metadata repository.
AWS Athena: Serverless SQL queries for data analysis.
AWS QuickSight: Data visualization and dashboarding.
Project Workflow
Data Upload to S3

Upload the Superstore dataset (CSV format) to an S3 bucket (e.g., s3://your-bucket-name/superstore/).
AWS Glue Crawler

Create a Glue Crawler to scan the dataset in S3 and infer its schema.
Configure the Crawler to update the Glue Data Catalog with a new table.
AWS Glue Data Catalog

The Crawler creates a metadata table in the Glue Data Catalog, which Athena can query.
Query with AWS Athena

Use Athena to query the Superstore data directly from the Glue Data Catalog.
Perform various SQL operations for data analysis (e.g., sales by region, profit analysis).
Visualize with AWS QuickSight

Connect QuickSight to Athena to create interactive dashboards.
Visualize metrics like sales trends, category performance, and regional breakdowns.
Setup Instructions
1. Prepare S3 Bucket
Create an S3 bucket in your AWS account (e.g., superstore-data-analysis).
Upload the Superstore dataset (e.g., superstore.csv) to a designated folder (e.g., s3://superstore-data-analysis/raw-data/).
2. Configure AWS Glue Crawler
Navigate to the AWS Glue Console.
Create a new Crawler:
Name: superstore-crawler
Data Source: S3 path (s3://superstore-data-analysis/raw-data/)
IAM Role: An IAM role with S3 read access and Glue permissions.
Run the Crawler to populate the Glue Data Catalog.
3. Query Data with Athena
Open the Athena Console.
Select the Glue database created by the Crawler.
Write SQL queries to analyze the Superstore dataset. Examples:
-- Total sales by region
SELECT region, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM superstore_table
GROUP BY region;

-- Top 5 profitable products
SELECT product_name, SUM(profit) AS total_profit
FROM superstore_table
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY total_profit DESC
LIMIT 5;
4. Visualize Data in QuickSight
Navigate to the AWS QuickSight Console.
Connect QuickSight to Athena:
Create a dataset from your Athena table.
Build dashboards:
Add visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps.
Explore metrics like total sales, category performance, and regional trends.
Sample Queries
Sales by Region

SELECT region, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM superstore_table
GROUP BY region;
Top 10 Customers by Sales

SELECT customer_name, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM superstore_table
GROUP BY customer_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
Monthly Sales Trend

SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS year, 
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month, 
       SUM(sales) AS monthly_sales
FROM superstore_table
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month;
